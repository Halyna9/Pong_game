# Pong_game

## Introduction
This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python's Turtle module. In this game, two players control paddles on opposite sides of the screen, and they must bounce a ball back and forth. The game continues until one player misses the ball, at which point the opponent scores a point.

## Features
- Two-player mode: Players can control the paddles using the arrow keys (for the right paddle) and the 'W' and 'S' keys (for the left paddle).
- Ball movement: The ball moves continuously across the screen, bouncing off walls and paddles.
- Score tracking: The game keeps track of each player's score and displays it on the screen.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Turtle module (included in Python standard library)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed.
3. Run the `pong_game.py` file.
4. Use the arrow keys ('Up' and 'Down') to control the right paddle, and the 'W' and 'S' keys to control the left paddle.
5. Try to prevent the ball from passing your paddle while also aiming to make the ball pass your opponent's paddle.
6. The game ends when one player misses the ball, and the opponent scores a point.
